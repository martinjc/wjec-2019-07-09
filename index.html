                        Hello, and thank you. I'm Dr Martin Chorley, I'm from the School of Computer
                        Science and Informatics at Cardiff University. I'm not a journalist, and up
                        until a few years ago would not have considered myself anything like a
                        journalism educator, so I'm very pleased to be here at WJEC.

                        A little over 7 years ago, I was contacted out of the blue over Twitter by
                        my colleague Glyn Mottershead, who at that point I had never met or spoken
                        to. He wanted to discuss an idea with me, and so because meeting strangers
                        off the Internet is the sort of thing I do, we met and we talked - a wide
                        ranging discussion covering all sorts of geeky topics, including the overlap
                        between Computer Science and Journalism. The end result of this conversation
                        was that we ended up convincing ourselves that we needed to design a new MSc
                        programme to cover what we understood as a skills gap in Journalism
                        education.

                        2 years of university approval process and a lot of paperwork later, we were
                        able to launch what is now known as the MSc in Computational and Data
                        Jouralism. Designed with a strong input from industry, the course focuses on
                        practical skills and aims to deliver graduates with the technical skills
                        needed for a range of roles both in the newsroom and outside the media
                        industry. What I'm going to do in this talk is to share some of our
                        experiences and reflection from the first five years of the programme.

                            One thing we were sure of right from the beginning is that we wanted to
                            move beyond just a tools based approach. Having a large set of tools
                            that you can use as a journalist is great, but at the forward edges of
                            any industry that is connected to technology, things move fast, and
                            things break all the time, and this is often by design. During the time
                            we've been running the programme we've seen any number of free tools for
                            data collection, scraping or analysis pivot to a freemium or even
                            premium model that leaves organisations struggling for funding out in
                            the cold. This can be a significant challenge, and we want students that
                            can get past these issues.

                        Which is part of the reason for heading down the more coding intensive
                        'computational' path. Why 'computational' - why not just 'data journalism'.
                        We want graduates who are capable beyond the simple applications of tools
                        and processes to relatively small or easily handled data - we're looking
                        more at graduates able to apply computational thinking processes
                        (simplification, abstraction, modelling, solution building) within
                        journalism - using larger and more complex data sets, unstructured data -
                        problems that may sometimes require the building of new tools and processes
                        to allow the story to be discovered and told. I'm not saying here that all
                        journalists should learn to code. But as a computer scientist, I strongly
                        believe that more people should understand the computational approach and
                        the benefits it can bring

                        Of course, given that we're designing a course that is covering a very new
                        area, there's no guidebook in play that could help us. The QAA in the UK
                        does not have subject level benchmarks for Computational Journalism, and the
                        professional accrediting bodies are somewhat behind the times when it comes
                        even to fairly standard 'data' journalism, let alone anything more
                        technical, and of course this can be understood when you consider that not
                        all journalists striclty need these skills, no matter how much we would
                        prefer that they have them

                        has four key areas of Data and Computational Journalism Teaching. You can
                        easily get to the first two with some basic 'in-house' j-school coding, or
                        even using simple tools-based training and teaching, and might stretch to
                        the third, but the fourth is unreachable without a solid foundation of CS
                        learning that you are not going to get without CS involvement in the course.

                        "Journalism schools should build collaborative partnerships with other
                        disciplines. Many professional schools, journalism included, have tended to
                        operate as silos within universities because they draw their culture and
                        concerns from a field of practice rather than a tradition of academic
                        discourse. That stance must shift because journalism itself is shifing. As a
                        result, we should recognize that journalism is not a narrow set of
                        traditional newsroom skills, but instead encompasses whatever tools and
                        methods have, in one way or another, been made journalistic"

                        Our first challenge with this course is around access. This is not just a
                        'finishing school' for journalism graduates - we wanted this course to be
                        open to as many people as possible, which means our intake has a very wide
                        spread. We accept journalism graduates of course, alongside working
                        journalists (many of whom take a career break to come and re-train with us),
                        but we also take in more technical STEM graduates, who perhaps have coding
                        experience and no journalistic knowledge, or even graduates from other
                        disciplines who have neither coding nor journalistic background. This wide
                        range of intakes presents many challenges, and I'll mention a few of the
                        ways we have overcome these in a moment

                        So in the first semester our students study 20 credits of Journalism modules
                        and 40 credits of Computer Science modules. To begin with, the Data
                        Journalism module was actually a 'Digital Journalism' module, but as the
                        Journalism School recognised the importance of Data skills (and because the
                        'Digital' skills being taught in the digital module had been largely
                        subsumed into other modules), it was swapped out for the Data Journalism
                        module. This gives the students a much better understanding of Data at an
                        earlier stage of the programme. This starts from a tool based approach (used
                        across all the PGT programmes in the School of Journalism), but also
                        advances into R as the students gain coding knowledge on the Computer
                        Science side. On this side, they are taught introductory programming modules
                        alongside other students on 'conversion' degree programmes in the School.
                        This provides a very useful learning experience which the students would not
                        get if we were purely teaching coding within a Journalism programme: the
                        students are able to see and hear from other students who are also
                        approaching coding for the first time, and are able to understand that they
                        are not necessarily special or unique just because of their
                        background/intended career. 'Coding is hard for us as journalists' is a
                        thing we have heard before, and being able to point at the other 90 students
                        in the class and provide a counter-example is very helpful - look, here is
                        someone with an english degree who is also finding this tough, and here is
                        someone else who isn't - yes learning to code can be tricky, or it can be
                        easy, and seeing the wide range of experiences is therefore helpful. It also
                        allows a real connectivist approach to the learning - students can form
                        learning networks with other students, improving their learning experiences.
                        Of course, this is a trade-off, because it means that some of the coding
                        examples they see early on are perhaps not specifically or easily applied to
                        the journalistic context. This can be good, because it allows the student to
                        understand the wider context and the larger general applicability of the
                        techniques and skills they are learning, but can also alienate them slightly
                        from the learning, if the direct applicability is not easily seen. One
                        solution to this is the first semester 'harmonisation seminars' we run.

                        The Lab 'harmonisation seminars' are an space within the programme with no
                        formal assessment that allow us to do two things: 1. they allow us to help
                        get everyone up to the same level in the wide range of skills - so we can
                        support those students needing help with coding more, or those students
                        needing help with writing more. 2. They allow us to start to apply the
                        skills they are learning in other modules on side projects, and show how the
                        two things relate together. Within this space we can provide a safe space
                        for the students to explore, experiment, and really importantly fail with no
                        consequences. We can use this space to begin side projects (that may evolve
                        later in the second semester to larger scale projects) and to provide the
                        students with opportunities to begin creating their portfolio of projects
                        (useful for employment later)

                        modules - on the Computer Science side they can pick things such as Data
                        Visualisation, or Human Centric Computing. On the Journalism side there are
                        academic modules looking at Business Journalism, managing media, crisis
                        reporting and so on. The key part of the second semester is a team
                        investigative project lasting all semester, where students work in groups to
                        create 'something' - somehwere on a scale from a 'traditional' data
                        investigation and reporting, to a newsroom tool to aid
                        investigations/reporting. Authentic learning experience - close to real
                        world (as close a 'simulation' as we can get). In this project, the students
                        pitch ideas to us and the rest of the class, and then work on projects for
                        11 weeks, until final delivery at the end of the semester. This module has
                        been singled out by our external examiner, (an editor at a national news
                        organisation in the UK) as being an exemplary experience for the students,
                        and replicating real world situations in the newsroom as far as possible.
                        Examples of the types of projects that students complete in this module have
                        included a tool that links trending news articles on news websites to emoji
                        use on Twitter, a large data investigation into the effect of austerity in
                        the UK on educational funding, and a large-scale analysis of Instagram
                        hashtags connected to self-harm. This module often suffers from the usual
                        problems that are found in group modules, and sometimes the teams need a
                        careful watch to ensure that the group dynamics do not shift too much and
                        cause the team to tip into a crisis. We've noticed this sometimes threatens
                        particularly when combining experienced working journalists with younger
                        less-experienced students, or when attempting to bring people with a very
                        individualistic approach into a team project

                        The ultimate proof of whether the programme works or not is of course down
                        to the outcomes of the students, and we think this is where we can show a
                        definite success. Many of our former students are now working in newsrooms
                        around the globe, in roles ranging from newsroom developer, through
                        visualisation producer, and into more 'traditional' data journalist roles.
                        Our graduates are working for The Guardian, The Times and the Sunday Times,
                        The Bureau Local (part of the TBIJ), NZZ in Switzerland, and Data Journalism
                        outfits in India. We also have graduates working outside of traditional news
                        media in news type roles, such as for the Office of National Statistics in
                        the UK. And then of course we have a range of students who have gone on to
                        non-media or news roles, working in PR or consultancy, which demonstrates
                        the transferability and wide applicability of the skills covered in the
                        course.
